# JavaScript Design Patterns

### What constitutes a pattern?

- It solves a problem.
- It is a proven concept.
- The solution is not obvious.
- Describes a relationship (9/10 times deals with a relationship)
- It has a significant human component (requires thought)

### Why bother with patterns?

- Why solve it again? Use someone else's solution. Lazy programmer === good programmer.
- Common vocabulary.

### Types of patterns.

- Creational: deals with the creation of new instances of an object

  - constructor (specific to JS)
  - Module (specific to JS)
    - grouping of like methods or a service of some sort
  - Factory
  - Singleton

- Structural: deals with the make up of the actual objects themselves

  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight

- Behavorial (these 3 are fairly well used in JS, most popular): deals with how objects relate to each other & how they operate
  - Command
  - Mediator
  - Observer
